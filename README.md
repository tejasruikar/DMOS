# Distributed Multiprocessor Operating Systems

Team mebers:


• Implemented routines that will allow a program to run, with multiple threads, using NON-preemptive scheduling on most Unix/Linux operating systems.

• Extending above mentioned project,implemented routines that implements semaphores and then use them to implement the readers/writers problem.

• Developed a module that does message passing via ports.

• Client-server architecture for file transfer. Clients can upload files and server accepts file-name and file data from client and writes them to the files. Developed server was single threaded and could support 3 concurrent transfers.
